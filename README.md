## How It Works

### Analog Clock:

* Uses `setInterval()` to update every second.
* Rotates hands using `transform: rotate()` based on current time.

### Sticky Notes:

* Click **`+`** button to add a note.
* Notes are assigned a random pastel color and rotation.
* Text is editable.
* Each note includes a **delete button (×)**.
* All changes are saved to `localStorage` automatically.

---

## Responsive Behavior

* Full functionality across devices (desktops, tablets, mobiles).
* Sticky notes rearrange and resize based on screen width.

---

## Local Storage Format

Notes are saved as an array of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Buy groceries",
    "color": "note-2",
    "rotation": "rotate(-1deg)"
  }
]
```
